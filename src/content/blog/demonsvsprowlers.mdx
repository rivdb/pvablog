### Overview

The fourth game of the regular season, the Dallas Demons (Captained by Jordan) and the Chicago Prowlers (Captained by Reflex).

Demons was the home team, which led them to choosing Fracture for their map pick.

Demons being the highest ranked team in the preseason, and walking into this game after a tough loss had their heads held high in hopes they could prove that it was all a fluke. 

Demons boast a strong lineup with notable players like Makks and Rivers. However, despite the hopes of Demons, they didn't have a solid IGL, and were outmatched by Brey, the Prowler's experienced IGL. 

This game was led by strong momentum shifts, with phenomenal plays. Bxrn was hitting shots left and right showing he could be one of the best, and Aki- who we have to remind you was subbing in, put up crazy numbers.

### Quotes

After conversing with the players after the game, we were able to get a few quick words from some of the players:

**Reflex** (Captain of the Prowlers), didn't understand what quote was, but had this to say:  
> The Chicago Prowlers are the undeniable force in Valorant, and with Reflex leading the charge, there’s no doubt they’ll dominate the PVA league. Reflex isn’t just the best player—he’s the heartbeat of this team, elevating every play, every round. The Prowlers have the skill, the strategy, and the unstoppable drive to claim the PVA title and show the world who truly reigns supreme in Valorant. Jordan is horrible at valorant.

**Rivers** (Player for the Demons):  
>Lots of team comp issues that game, I feel like some of us just don't know what to play. We're gonna be fixing this next week though.

### Final Thoughts

The Demons have lots of work to do. They're making big roster changes, so we'll start to see how they look in the following weeks. This is looking rough, as they were ranked the 1st in the pre-season rankings. Additionally, the Prowlers are looking deadly under Reflex's leadership, who's the youngest captain in PVA history.
