### Overview

The first game of the regular season kicks off, with Phoenix Pistols (led by KuJo) finishing **13-3** against the Philadelphia Patriots (led by Party). 

Phoenix Pistols was the home team, meaning it was their map pick (Haven).

In the [Preseason Rankings](https://playpva.online/blog/s4draft), Patriots were actually ranked *above* the Pistols, so this comes as a big surprise. Contrary to our assumption, it was actually i1siahh and jardongis that were IGL'ing, *not* TristanJ.

### Quotes

We joined the Pistols' voice channel for a quick post-game interview, and they had some interesting words:


i1saiahh: "Bro we chilling, we vibing, we're in a good mood"

jardongis: "It's gonna happen every single game so it doesn't really matter"

We also asked Party for his thoughts, and he had this to say:

Party: "Main thing I wanna say is even though it was a tough loss, a lot of us are still warming up and personal performances will increase from all of us as the season continues, bit disappointing but we bounce back."

### Final Thoughts

The Pistols looked unstoppable, their strong suit is definitely their IGL'ing- they were able to rotate effectively, especially on a 3-lane map like Haven. The Patriots could definitely improve, they have a radiant duelist (Trip).
