The first game of the regular season kicks off, with Phoenix Pistols (led by KuJo) finishing **13-3** against the Philadelphia Patriots (led by Party). In the [Preseason Rankings](https://playpva.online/blog/s4draft), Philadelphia Patriots was actually ranked *above* the Phoenix Pistols, so this comes as a big surprise.

We joined the Phoenix Pistols' voice channel for a quick post-game interview, and they had some interesting words:

i1saiahh: "Bro we chilling, we vibing, we're in a good mood"

jardongis: "It's gonna happen every single game so it doesn't really matter"

Contrary to our assumption, it was actually i1siahh and jardongis that were IGL'ing, *not* TristanJ.
