### Overview

In this Week 2 showdown, the Phoenix Pistols hosted the Miami Manatees on Haven.

Phoenix bounced back in style with a commanding 13-5 victory after a tough loss to the Chicago Prowlers in Week 1. **Tristanj** was the clear MVP of the match, delivering an incredible 24-11 performance on Yoru, dominating both on attack and defense. **JesusTheBoss** also stepped up with a strong 17-8 statline, providing consistent frags and clutch plays to secure crucial rounds.

For Miami, **Crazy** was the lone standout, finishing with a respectable 19-15 statline. Despite his efforts to keep Miami in the fight, the team struggled to counter the Pistols, as they were not able to take even a single round second half. Miami also decided to release **Washed Up** directly after the game for bringing down the team's mental, yelling at the team, and making racist comments mid game, according to Miami's Captain **Pope**

# Final Thoughts

Phoenix showed how dominate they can realy be, with **Tristanj** and **JesusTheBoss** leading the charge. This win could mark a turning point for the Pistols as they look to build momentum in the coming weeks.

Miami, on the other hand, will need to regroup and address their struggles with adapting to these more aggressive playstyles. Crazyâ€™s performance highlighted his potential, but the team as a whole will need to step up to compete with top-tier opponents.
