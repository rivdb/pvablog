# We're Back!
It’s official—PVA is back. After a year-long break, we’re ready to hit the ground running. This isn’t just a return to the league we had before; it’s a fresh start, with new faces, revived rivalries, and the promise of something even better.

Season 1 of the PVA Revival kicks off on __January 10th, 2025__, and we want you to be a part of it. Whether you’re an old pro or looking to join for the first time, this is the perfect time to dive in. Bring your friends, bring your A-game, and join us: Sign up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MmGPbxgqjj).


From now on, we want to be as transparent as possible with what’s happening regarding changes in the league. Here’s how our new season will look:

# New Season Structure

**1/10/25-1/12/25: Draft Games**
If you’ve been in PVA before, you should be familiar with how this is run, but for all the new players, this weekend is where you will be able to show off your skills to the Captains. You will randomly sorted into and play 1 5v5 custom game. These games will take place between 7-9pm EST

**1/13/25 Draft Day:**
We will be holding the Draft on the Monday following the Draft Games. We will be allowing Captains to draft **up to** 10 players onto their teams. However, in the week leading up to Week 1 of the regular season, they will have to cut their team back to 7 total players. 2 teams however, will not be drafting, Dallas Demons and Chicago Prowlers will be premade teams (comprised of mostly ex-PVA players) we want these teams to set the standard in PVA. This may sound unfair to the team drafting, but everything will even out, trust us.

**1/17/25-2/16/25 Regular Season:** 
The regular season will determine seeding for the playoffs. Each team will play every team in a BO1 only once. Inter-conference records will matter WAY more this season, and will be used to determine conference playoff seeding. The team with the worst record from each conference will not make the playoffs.

**2/21/25-2/23/25 Playoffs:**
Pretty simple playoff seeding, #1 seed will receive a bye, and the #2 will play #3. The winners will go on to play in their Conference Finals and the winners to the League Finals. Playoff games will be a BO3. The League Finals however, will be a BO5 and the home team will be decided by coinflip.
