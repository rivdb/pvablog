# Player Spotlight

Sitting at the top of our list is a player many of you are already familiar with- **Bxrn**. Bxrn is already known for his aggressive playstyle, complimented by his cracked aim. He got drafted to the Louisiana Gators, a team led by **Kota**. 

Second on our list is **Makks**. Makks will be playing for Dallas Demons, he has little experience in team environments, but he's a smokes player with insane mechanics- he might just be what the **Dallas Demons** need.

Coincidentally, our next and third player, **Pies**, was also drafted to the **Louisiana Gators**. Pies was known as an extremely cracked duelist, but we only saw him on Sova in the draft games.

Our fourth player is an already well known player, who was possibly even top 5 at some point- **Trip**. Trip got drafted to the **Philadelphia Patriots**, which will be led by **Party**. He's a duelist player who prefers to leverage his aim.

Last but not least is **Smokejazz**- who got drafted to the **Phoenix Pistols**,  a team led by **Kujo**. We don't know much about him yet, but in the draft game he played, his shots were clean and his positioning was on point. We'll se in due time if he lives up to expectations.

# Team Rankings
1. **Dallas Demons** - Boasting players like **EliSosa**, **Rivers**, and **Typebait**, this team already looked strong, With the additions of **King** and **Makks**, they look even better.
2. **Chicago Prowlers** - With the experienced IGL **Brey**, and cracked player **Lethal**, this team could easily surpass Dallas.
3. **Philadelphia Patriots** - **Trip** has proven himself as a consistently great player, and **MacMill** has a chance to shine as potentially a top 3 IGL. This team looks dangerous.
4. **Phoenix Pistols** - **Kujo** has already proved himself as an insane player. With him now being in charge of his own roster, who knows what could happen. Additionally, the team is bringing in exciting new faces, such as **I1saiahh**, **JesusTheBoss**, and **SmokeJazz**.
5. **Louisiana Gators** - This team looks good on paper, but we're not sure if **Bxrn** and **Aki** will get along. They're two players that have had a fueled rivalry for a long time. However, **Pies** is an insane player, and **Blazen** used to be a proven smokes player. This team has potential.
6. **Miami Manatees** - Led by the new face on the block- **Pope**, we really don't know much about this team. This doesn't mean that they're dead in the water, since they boast exciting new talent, like **Steely**, **Akiyn**, and **VibeZ**.

> Keep in mind, this is just predictions. We've consistently had massive upsets, and teams are ranked based off what we know.
