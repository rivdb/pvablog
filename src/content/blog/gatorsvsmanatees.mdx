### Overview
The second game of the regular season, the Louisiana Gators (led by Kota) finish **13-4** against the Miami Manatees (led by Pope). 

Miami Manatees was the home team, meaning it was their map pick (Fracture).

In the [Preseason Rankings](https://playpva.online/blog/s4draft), The Manatees were ranked last, with the Louisiana Gators right above them. **However**, the Gators have made some massive roster changes, with the additions of Alectron, November, and most notably, Valqz. 

The highlights of this game were undoubtedly Valqz, who's Kota's duo, and Pies, who's proving why he's a top 5 duelist.
