### Overview

Game number one of the Saturday Dallas Demons doubleheader began with the Philadelphia Patriots (captained by Party) blowing out the Demons (led by Jordan) in an overwhelming 13-1 victory.

The Philadelphia Patriots, being the home team, were given the map pick, and they chose Lotus.

Looking at the Patriots' last game, we saw them being blown out by the Phoenix Pistols, which left us with a quote from Party: "...tough loss, a lot of us are still warming up, and personal performances will increase from all of us as the season continues... ." Could this be a sign of the Patriots warming up?

### Quotes

After conversing with the players after the game, we were able to get a few quick words from the captains:

**Party** (Captain of the Patriots):  
"Yeah, just wanted to say that despite our tough loss the day before, we kept our heads up and gave it our all. Our calls and shots were on point, and everyone can expect more of that in the future as we refine our coordination as a team."

**Jordan** (Captain of the Demons):  
"Just a bad game from all of us. Party and them just played it better."

**Rivers** (Player for the Demons):  
"We're going to have some roster changes. There was lots of internal conflict and role issues. Honestly, I think the team is just all over the place, but we're going to bounce back, I can guarantee it."

### Final Thoughts

The Patriots looked dominant throughout the match. Their best factor was definitely their ten first kills to the Demons' four. Being up players at the beginning of rounds is a very important part of deciding the winner of games. The Demons could take more empty space on defense to try and gain control of the map.
