### Overview

In the final game of Week 1, the Phoenix Pistols faced off against the Chicago Prowlers.

Chicago was the home team and picked Lotus.

Chicago continued their hot streak with a dominant 13-4 win over Phoenix. The obvious MVP of this game was Chicago's IGL, Brey, showcasing why he is one of the most consistent players in PVA. Brey delivered incredible clutches and boasted an impressive 25-10 stat line. 

Phoenix's Tristanj tried to carry his team but it just wasn't enough, as he was the only player on his team with a positive K/D. Phoenix is now on a two-game losing streak following another tough loss to the Louisiana Gators in their previous match. We'll have to see how they bounce back in their Week 2 game against the Manatees.
